# Importing Spotify Playlists Into Spinitron

##Exportify
- Go to Exportify using the following link: 
   https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html
- Click on "Get Started"
- Log in to your Spotify account and grant Exportify access to your playlists.
- Find the playlist you want exported and click export. This will download a .CSV file.

Now that we have the CSV downloaded, it's time to import it into Spinitron.

## Spinitron
- Log in to Spinitron and click on "Import a playlist" under the "Playlists" column.
- Select the show you are importing a playlist for. Ideally you are going to mark that you are working on the playlist "Before the show"
- Click Submit.
- On the next page, click on "Choose file" and just import the .CSV file you downloaded using Exportify.
- Now the next page will look like this:

- Make sure that your settings are exactly like in the image
   - Untick the box for the top row.
   - Mark "Song Name" above Track Name.
   - Mark "Artist Name" above Artist Name.
   - Mark "Disk Name" above Album Name.
   - Make sure "-ignore-" is marked for all the others.
- Click import and then click OK on the pop-up box.

## After.
- Now one drawback is that Spotify does not provide label names. From what I can tell, there is no work around to this. So we'll have to submit them ourselves.
- After you have imported the playlist, there will be a link right below "Imported n rows from the file you uploaded into the playlist."
- Click on that link and then click "Edit". 
- Now just add in all the missing information. We are primarily concerned with label info, but if you want to add any other information this is when you should do it. You can also submit other music you are going to play here, editing the playlist as you want.
- Done!
