## Importing Spotify Playlists Into Spinitron

1. Exportify
- Go to Exportify using the following link: 
   https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html
- Click on "Get Started"
- Log in to your Spotify account and grant Exportify access to your playlists.
- Find the playlist you want exported and click export. This will download a .CSV file.

Now that we have the CSV downloaded, it's time to import it into Spinitron.

2. Spinitron
- Log in to Spinitron and click on "Import a playlist" under the "Playlists" column.
- Select the show you are importing a playlist for. Make sure you mark that you are working on the playlist "Before the show"
- Click Submit.
- On the next page, click on "Choose file" and just import the .CSV file you downloaded using Exportify.
- Now the next page will look like this:
